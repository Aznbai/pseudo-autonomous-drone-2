# Pseudo Autonomous Drone ML 2
Arduino based probabalistic MIDI sequencer/composer
## Usage
PAD2 can be used as a chord pattern or melody generator with any MIDI device.
It is capable of producing formally correct and harmonic progressions. Main parameters of this generative process are changeable via the user interface: Tempo, Root Note, Scale, Progression and the probability of random change for each.
The probabilities of chord/note Transposition, Substitution, Mute and addition of 5th, 7th, 11t obertones are also presented in UI.
